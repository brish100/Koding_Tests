'''
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving
more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving
objects and pass the request alon the chain until an object handles it.

Istedenfor at en object håndterer en spesifikk problemstilling så lager
mann en lenke med forskjellige noder, som sender oppgaven videre om de ikke klarer å gjøre oppgaven.
Slik at det ender opp med at en klarer å gjøre oppgaven.


Used to achieve loose coupling in software where a soecufued request from the client is passed through a chain of objects included in it.
It helps in building a chain of objects.
The request eneters from one end and moves from one object to another.


When to use:
	more than one object may handle a request, and the handler should be ascertained automatically
	you want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly
	the set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically

chain-of-responsibility-pattern
design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects.

Coupling the sender of request to its receiver should be avoided.
It should be possible that more than one receiver can handle a request.

Quite similar to the decorator pattern

The concept hovers around the concept,
that an object should be connected to a chain of linked objects,
where tasks are transferred if not executable(due to time/capacity reasons),
should be able to work on.
